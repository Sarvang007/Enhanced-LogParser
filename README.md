# 🚀 Enhanced Log Parser

A powerful Python-based log parsing and reporting tool built for Security Operations Centers (SOC). Analyze syslogs, Windows event logs, and custom application logs with ease, transforming raw data into actionable insights through structured reports, real-time dashboards, and advanced analytics.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Flexible Log Parsing**: Processes diverse log formats (syslogs, Windows event logs, custom logs).
- **Real-Time Processing**: Ingests and analyzes logs in real-time using lightweight Python queues.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Includes metrics, anomaly detection, and multi-source log correlation.
- **Visualizations**: Generates static charts (bar, pie) and interactive dashboards using Dash/Streamlit.
- **Structured Outputs**: Exports reports in CSV, JSON, and text formats for easy integration.

### Next Steps
```
- If you meant to display this README on GitHub, you can copy the above markdown content into a `README.md` file in your repository's root directory, and GitHub will automatically render it on the repository's main page.
- If you meant something else by "main screen" (e.g., a local application, a dashboard, or a specific display), please clarify, and I can provide further assistance, such as generating a file, suggesting a visualization, or explaining how to integrate this with a specific platform.
- If you'd like me to generate a chart based on the sample log data or project progress (e.g., a bar chart of tasks completed per phase), please confirm, and I can create one using the supported chart types.

Let me know how you'd like to proceed!
